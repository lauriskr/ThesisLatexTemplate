A solution for energy-efficient data collection for clustering-based wireless sensor networks has been suggested \cite{cluster_wsn_paper}. This solution has wireless sensor clusters with a head node, which actively decides if new sensor data should be requested from the nodes or if they can be predicted. The communication with the central data collection point goes through cluster heads only, which reduces transfer overhead. This is similar to the current thesis in a sense that data is predicted or requested and then forwarded, with the exception that this prototype does not have clusters and extra complexity that comes with clustering. 
The general implementation idea has been taken from this solution and prediction algorithm details, as in both cases simple linear regression is used to predict sensor data.

The previous prototype \cite{prev_thesis} is the main basis of this work as it was the starting point. The previous implementation used XMPP as the communication protocol and a fixed interval data collection. XMPP has several advantages over simple HTTP requests, mainly because the protocol supports message queues and security. However, actually useful security options (SSL/TLS) are unavailable due to their overhead and implementation complexity for Arduino boards. On the other hand, XMPP protocol has communication overhead which reduces its usability when fast connection establishment and data transmission is required.

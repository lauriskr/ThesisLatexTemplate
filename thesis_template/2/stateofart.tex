% ----------------------- State of the art ------------------------
%We will try to target 20 -25 word pages for this work
%probably after changing to Latex, the amount of pages will increase but that's because the template
%is double space and half page of each chapter is lost at the beginning, among others.

%XMPP description should fit in one page
\section{Jabber and XMPP}
Description of Jabber and XMPP protocol and its usage.

%arduino along with its component should be one and half page
%if there are configuration we will put them in the appendix
%or we can put a footnote with a link to your github account
\section{Arduino}
Introduction to Arduino.

\subsection{Arduino Mega ADK}
Overview of the Arduino Mega ADK board and its components.

\subsection{TinkerKit}
Overview of the TinkerKit module, components and sensors.

\subsection{Modules}
Overview of the Ethernet and Wireless Shields and WiFly wireless module.

%Fuzzy logic is the main contribution, therefore, you can write here up to 5 pages
\section{Fuzzy Logic}
Description of fuzzy logic and its uses.

%This one is not necessary, since we will just mention the tool and it will be cited in chapter 4
%\section{Power supply}
%Overview of the PeakTech 1890 power supply.

%Instead, try to investigate about related works
%both from academic and commercial points of view, it is unlikely that there is a commercial tool about it, but 
%maybe there is something, you can look for solutions for monitoring smart environments or so
%try to target 2 pages max. One or two paragraphs describing each solution
\section{Related Works}
%Some academic related work that can be mentioned is described below
%try to look for them in Google scholar
%From Instant Messaging to Cloud computing, a XMPP review (paper)
%XMPP for cloud computing in bioinformatics supporting discovery and invocation of asynchronous web services
%Performance Evaluation of XMPP on the Web

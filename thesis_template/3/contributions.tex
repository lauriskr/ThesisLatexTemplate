\section{Power Consumption}

The first problem addressed is power consumption. There are two main ideas behind reducing it - put the sensor module to sleep mode when not transmitting data and reduce the need for data transmission. For this, the server-side client was improved to predict sensor data when possible and notify the sensor module of the next data transmission time. This enables the module to enter sleep mode for the given time period and thus reduce power consumption. 

\subsection{Sleep}

Since the module consists of 3 components - Arduino Mega ADK, Wireless SD Shield with WiFly module and TinkerKit Sensor Shield. Both the Mega ADK and WiFly module support sleep modes. 

\subsubsection{Watchdog Timer}
A watchdog timer \cite{watchdog_timer} is an electronic timer used to recover from computer malfunctions. They are found in automated systems where human interference is not possible and therefore the system must be able to recover from malfunctions on its own. 
A watchdog timer essentially performs a timing function producing a delayed response to an input trigger. The most common implementation has a digital counter that counts from a specified value down to a terminal value. Usually the initial value is programmable. When the counter reaches the terminal value, the timer timeouts and triggers a timeout signal. Usually this means restarting the program from the start. A program can restart the watchdog timer at any time. The act of restarting is usually referred to as "kicking the dog". In this way, a program can be written which never lets the counter reach the terminal value.

\subsubsection{Arduino Mega ADK}

In case of an Arduino board, when the watchdog timer timeouts, the sketch is restarted (new call to $setup()$). Furthermore, a watchdog timeout signal is sent and this signal can be captured by the sketch. In the Arduino sketch, this is implemented by the JeeLib library \cite{jeelib_general}. JeeLib is a library written for experimenting with JeeLabs products, however, some parts of the library are written for Arduino boards and can be used with them. Specifically, the Ports class \cite{jeelib_port} is the one used in this implementation to put the Arduino Mega ADK into sleep mode. The sketch execution stops for the specified sleep time and afterwards execution continues from the call to sleep function.

\todo{Add a sample overview of the sketch here maybe}

\subsubsection{WiFly module}

The RN-XV WiFly module can be put to sleep in two ways - sleep timer or sleep command. With the sleep timer, the shield will enter sleep mode after a specified time period has passed since all TCP active connections have closed. With the sleep command the module will enter sleep mode immediately, unless an active TCP connection exists. \cite{wifly_manual}. 

This means that in order to put the WiFly module to sleep, all active connections must be closed. For the XMPP session, this means closing the active stream and the underlying TCP connection. Once this has been done, the module can successfully enter sleep mode. 

The module can be waken up by either sending characters of the UART or by using the wake timer. In our implementation the activity on the UART wakes the module up when the sketch execution continues after the Mega ADK wakes up from sleep mode and establishes a new TCP connection in the start of $loop()$ method call. This effectively means going through the first 5 stages of XMPP session lifecycle on every wake up. 
Since XMPP session initialization is quite verbose and the communication over Wi-Fi is unstable, the possibility of receiving scrambled or incomplete messages creates a problem. 

\subsection{Communication}

Because all TCP connections and therefore the XMPP session have to be closed after every data transmit, XMPP session lifecycle steps 1 - 5 shown in \autoref{xmpp_lifecycle} are executed multiple times. When testing the XMPP implementation with Arduino Mega ADK and WiFly module sleep modes enabled, a troubling fact was discovered - the XMPP session negotiation fails at least once for every 30 minute test. The reason for these connection failures are scrambled authentication or stream opening stanzas. 

From the tests, it could be seen that the average XMPP session start up time was 15 seconds. Data needs to be transmitted every 10 seconds, which means that the module can never be put to sleep as it will not be able to go through the sleep and wake up cycle during the available time period. Moreover, data transmission took on average 1 second, meaning that 15 seconds spent on wake up would result in a second of actual work, which is not efficient. 

During testing the sleep and wake up cycles with XMPP, it was found that XMPP session negotiation will hang approximately once in 15 minutes. As the maximum sleep time in our implementation is 65 seconds, this means that there are at least 13 separate session negotiations. Of course, this is the problem of the XMPP library in use and its lack of error handling. Problems with the library could be addressed with a better implementation, however, there was another factor discovered during the tests.

As a result, XMPP as a means of communication was not viable when trying to minimize power consumption. As an alternative, web sockets, raw sockets and HTTP was considered. Web sockets were left out because a web socket connection is opened with an HTTP request. Thus, using that one request to actually send the data is more efficient. Therefore, HTTP was preferred to web sockets. Raw socket implementation in Arduino would add needless complexity to the sketch and was therefore not implemented. Here is a sample of used HTTP request:

\begin{lstlisting}
POST /data/ HTTP/1.1
Host: ec2-54-224-196-78.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 105

{"location":1, "data":[{"type":1, "value":  7.87}, {"type":2, \
"value":512.00},{"type":3, "value":166.00}]}
\end{lstlisting}

The main advantages of HTTP are connection initialization speed and simplicity. The average time to wake up from sleep mode, send an HTTP request and receive response from the server, was measured to be around 6 seconds. In the previous scenario of 10 second transmission interval, it would mean 4 seconds could be spent in sleep mode, 4 seconds to wake up and transmit the data. This implementation would be more energy efficient, which can be seen in \autoref{30s_interval_power}. The data was gathered while running the prototype for 30 minutes with a data sending interval of 30 seconds. The sleep times were adjusted for both configurations based on their wake up times. As seen in the figure, the HTTP configuration consumes approximately 20\% less power than the one using XMPP.

\label{30s_interval_power}
\end{figure}

\section{Server-side Client}

With the move from XMPP to HTTP, the server-side client's implementation changed. Instead of using XMPP Smack library, a web server was needed. Jetty was selected because of its simplicity and possibility to embed it into the application. A web server embedded in an application is useful when prototyping, because it saves time on configuration and deployment. 

Furthermore, to take full advantage of the newly developed sleep mode functionality, the client was further developed to predict sensor values for some time. Two modules were added the server for this - simple linear regression and fuzzy control engine. In addition, the data model was modified to suit the new modules. The final web server consists of 4 modules and a figure of the architecture can be seen in \autoref{final_solution}

\begin{enumerate}
\item HTTP Request handler
\item Prediction module (Linear regression model)
\item Fuzzy control engine
\item Data storage
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.46]{4/figures/finalsolution.png}
\caption{Final Solution Architecture}
\label{final_solution}
\end{figure}

The new data model can be seen in \autoref{data_model_final}. $Data$ table now has $measured$ field, which indicates if the value has been measured or predicted. $SensorTypes$ table has two new fields - $regression\_error$ and $measure\_error$. $regression\_error$ is the acceptable regression model error for future predictions. $measure\_error$ indicates the acceptable variance for measured values.

\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{4/figures/data_model_final.jpg}
\caption{Updated Server-side Data Model}
\label{data_model_final}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Prediction Module}

A simple linear regression model was selected to predict future data, which uses the least squares method to calculate the future values. A linear regression models is sufficient to predict sensor data \cite[p. 1066]{cluster_wsn_paper}. The model has a single explanatory variable - Unix time. This variable is used to predict the future values of sensor readings based on previous measurements. 

The model sample is taken from previous measurements during the last 4 minutes. The 4 minute interval is selected to balance out errors caused by extreme values. This is necessary because a single value with big enough deviation can cause the regression model to become inaccurate. 

To measure the accuracy of the model, an confidence level of 90\% was introduced. If the sample for last 4 minutes provides an accurate enough regression model, then the predictions can be used. Otherwise, fresh data should be queried and added to the model until the error threshold is satisfied. The equation to calculate regression model's confidence level $\alpha$ \cite[p. 1066]{cluster_wsn_paper}:\\

\begin{center}
$\alpha = 2\Phi \left ( \frac{\epsilon}{RMSE}  \right ) - 1$.
\end{center}

Here $\Phi$ is the CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) of residuals, $\epsilon$ is the allowed error (in the database model named as $regression\_error$ and $RMSE$ is the root mean square error (also known as standard error of estimate) of the regression model The original equation used standard deviation of errors instead of RMSE, but RMSE is used here because of computational ease and because RMSE is the square root of the mean squared deviation \cite{RMSE} which describes the same thing as standard deviation (deviations from the mean). 

Regression models are created separately for each sensor. Each model has a sample of previous measurements and the allowed error $\epsilon$ defined in the database. 
The confidence level $\alpha$ is calculated for each model and has to be over $90\%$ which is the selected confidence threshold. If all regression models satisfy the confidence level, then the fuzzy control system is initialized with data from previous measurements and calculated confidence levels. 

\subsection{Fuzzy Logic Engine}

The next step in predicting future sensor values is to calculate the time interval for the next measurement request. To calculate the time, a fuzzy control system was introduced to provide flexible decisions based on multiple input variables. The input variables are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $temp$					
\item $temp$ $predictability$	
\item $light$					
\item $light$ $predictability$	
\item $hall$					
\item $hall$ $predictability$
\end{enumerate}

Here each sensor has a pair of input variables - measured sensor value and sensor value predictability (regression model confidence level $\alpha$). All these variables are mapped into fuzzy sets, a procedure call fuzzification. The predictability variables are mapped into sets which all have the same membership functions shown in figure \autoref{pred_sets}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.58]{4/figures/pred_sets.pdf}
\caption{Regression Confidence Fuzzy Sets}
\label{pred_sets}
\end{figure}

The fuzzy control system is initialized with a previous measurement for each sensor. This effectively sets the bounds of each sensor's fuzzy sets as seen in \autoref{change_sets}. The $PREDICTABLE$ fuzzy set's DOM (degree of membership) reaches maximum at a confidence level of 0.95 or 95\% because for our prototype anything above that level is highly predictable. 

The measured sensor values are fuzzified into sets, which each have different membership functions. The membership functions are calculated on the last measurement received as seen in \autoref{change_sets}. Here $X$ in set labels notes the sensor type currently used as the sets are the same relative to each sensor's previous measurement. The center point $O$ is the previously measured value. $||X_2X_3||$ is the predefined sensor measurement error  ($sensor\_error$ field in the data model). This means that if the new measurement is between the points $X_2$ and $X_3$, there is no change in the measurement for the fuzzy system. The lengths $||X_0X_2||$, $||X_1O||$, $||OX_4||$ and $||X_3X_5||$ are defined by the same variable $slope\_width$. Currently, slope width is the same as the selected $regression\_error$ values which are 5 times the value of $measure\_error$. The selected error values can be seen in \autoref{errors_table}. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{4/figures/change_sets.pdf}
\caption{Sensor Value Fuzzy Sets}
\label{change_sets}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
    \hline
     & Temp & Hall & LDR \\ \hline
    $measure\_error$ & 0.1 & 0.5 & 10 \\ \hline
    $regression\_error$ & 0.5 & 2.5 & 50 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Selected Error Values}
\label{errors_table}
\end{table}

The output variable is defuzzified from the idle time sets which have membership functions described in \autoref{idle_sets}. The sets $request$ and $predict$ are symmetrical to enable easy defuzzification. The maximum idle time is 65 seconds, which is the maximum length of one sleep cycle for the sensor module. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.58]{4/figures/result_sets.pdf}
\caption{Idle Time Fuzzy Sets}
\label{idle_sets}
\end{figure}

When all input variables have been fuzzified and degrees of membership calculated, then the next step is to fire all predefined rules. For each sensor, there is a collection of 3 rules, making a total of 9 rules (here $x \in \{hall, temp, light\}$):

\begin{enumerate}
\item IF $x$ IS $x\_changed\_left$ OR $x\_changed\_right$ AND $x\_predictability$ IS $not\_predictable$ OR $predictable$ THEN $request$
\item IF $x$ IS $x\_same$ AND $x\_predictability$ IS $not\_predictable$ THEN $request$
\item IF $x$ IS $x\_same$ AND $x\_predictability$ IS $predictable$ THEN $predict$
\end{enumerate}

The previously calculated degrees of membership are fed into these rules. For $AND$ relationship, the minimum value is selected, for $OR$ relationship, the maximum value is selected. For each rule, the output variable received a DOM equal to the DOM of the premise. When all rules have been evaluated, the results are defuzzified into a single crisp value, which is the idle time decision. This process is called defuzzification.

During defuzzification the DOMs of result sets $request$ and $predict$ for each rule are combined into a single DOM for the specified set. For this, $request$ output has an $OR$ relationship (maximum value) and the $predict$ set has an $AND$ relationship (minimum value). These relationships mean that the most inaccurate sensors would be represented in the final result. For example if $hall$ has a DOM of 1.0 to $predict$, but $temp$ has a DOM of 0.5 to $predict$, then the outcome would be a DOM of 0.5, because we need the output for least accurate sensors. For $request$ this logic is reversed as the maximum DOM to $request$ represents the output for the least accurate sensor. 

The next step is to get the crisp result value. For this process, the idle time values for $predict$ and $request$ set membership functions at the specified DOM are calculated. $x$ is found the equation $f(x) = DOM$, where $x$ is the idle time and $f$ is the membership function. $request$ and $predict$ membership functions are symmetric with the axis being in the point $x = 0$ as seen in \autoref{idle_sets}. The final defuzzified idle time is equal to $max\{x_{predict} - x_{request}, 10\}$. Meaning that if the DOM to $request$ was higher that to predict, then the default idle time of 10 seconds is returned. Otherwise the value at the center point of the two results is returned.

When the crisp result is received from the fuzzy control system and idle time is longer than 10 seconds, future data is predicted for the idle period. This means that using the regression models, future values with 10 second intervals are inserted into the database for each sensor. 

Finally, the idle time with a minimum value of 10 seconds is written as a JSON format string to the response body of the HTTP request. A sample response would look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 12
Connection: close
Server: Jetty(7.2.0.v20101020)

{"idle": 34}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Results}

\subsection{PeakTech 1890 Power Supply}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{4/figures/peaktech.pdf}
\caption{PeakTech 1890}
\label{peaktech}
\end{figure}

A PeakTech 1890 programmable power supply was used when testing the power consumption of the Arduino sensor module. The power supply enables to set variable output voltage and current values and has RS-232 and RS-485 interfaces for connecting with external devices. The RS-232 interface was used to collect drawn current values with 1 second interval. The power supply can be seen in \autoref{peaktech}

\subsection{Overview of Tests}

All average current tests were carried out using the PeakTech 1890 power supply. The power supply collects data with 1 second interval for 1800 seconds (30 minutes). 30 minutes is long enough to get the data of average current drawn. The 9V battery tests were carried out in the same environment to make the data more comparable. 

When testing with the server hosted in an Amazon EC2 micro instance, it was discovered that the previously used 3G wireless connection was not stable enough to provide consistent connections. Previous tests were made in a local area network where 3G was sufficient. To fix this, a switch to local Wi-Fi connection was made, the connection speeds were measured at 17.68 Mb/s download and 23.44 Mb/s upload. The latency of HTTP response for the we server was measured with Google Chrome web browser's developer tools console and produced an average of 120ms. 

\subsection{Test Results}

Firstly, the average current drawn in a second was measured for the original XMPP implementation, the final HTTP implementation with a hard coded 10 second idle time (same as the original XMPP version) and finally, the HTTP implementation with variable idle times enabled. The results can be seen in \autoref{final_current_measurements} and \autoref{current_measurements_table}. As seen from the table, there was a 23\% improvement for the HTTP version with the same fixed idle time. With variable idle times, the improvement was 42\% with the average idle time measured at 37.15 seconds. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

\label{final_current_measurements}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
     & Average current (mA) & Percentage & Improvement \\ \hline
    XMPP 10s interval & 111.74 & 100\% & \\ \hline
    HTTP 10s interval & 86.14 & 77\% & 23\% \\ \hline
    HTTP final & 64.39 & 58\% & 42\% \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\caption{Overview of Current Measurement Results}
\label{current_measurements_table}
\end{table}

Secondly, the module's lifetime on a 9V battery was tested. The result time was the time difference between the first and the last request received by the server-side client after powering the sensor module from a 9V battery. Two separate tests were carried out - one later in the day and one earlier to show behaviour in different conditions. The difference mainly involved the LDR sensor which is quite sensitive and slight fluctuations in lighting effect the measurements. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{4/figures/9V_test_results.png}
\caption{Battery Lifetime and Idle Time Comparison}
\label{9V_test_results}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
     & Lifetime (min) & Improvement (\%) & Total Idle Time (min)\\ \hline
    Previous Prototype & 161.5 & - & 0\\ \hline
    Test 1 & 340 & 111 & 266 \\ \hline
    Test 2 & 291 & 80 & 194 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\caption{9V Battery Lifetime Test Results}
\label{9V_measurements_table}
\end{table}

From \autoref{9V_measurements_table} it can be seen that the two test results differ a bit. This is because Test 1 was done in the evening and Test 2 was done during the day, which affects the LDR sensor's readings. During the day the sensor readings change a lot due to the variable lighting conditions. However, both tests confirm that the fuzzy control engine and prediction system work well together and that the overall battery lifetime has improved. The decrease in power consumption is dependent on the actual time spent in idle mode, because the more the module sleeps, the less power it consumes in total. 

As can be seen in \autoref{9V_test_results}, change in total idle time and battery lifetime have almost identical lines, which indicates that they are closely correlated. This, in fact, is quite logical because the main decrease in power consumption comes from utilizing idle mode as much as possible. 

The server-side client was not separately load tested, because the average request handling time was measured to be 53ms, which is quick enough to handle sensor module loads. Furthermore, since Jetty web server is a Java application server, which has proven itself in real commercial implementations, the solution was trusted to handle larger number of requests.

All in all, the outcome is positive with the daytime test giving an 80\% and the evening test giving 111\% improvement. The different results are caused by the selection of acceptable error values, which can be fine tuned based on the actual measurement characteristics needed.
